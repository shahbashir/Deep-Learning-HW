# Evaluate the performance of each model
### Conclusion
Using the testing data, evaluate each model and compare the performance.

Which model has a lower loss?

The closing price predictor model has a lower loss than the FNG predictor model.

Which model tracks the actual values better over time?

The closing price predictor model tracks the actual values better over time.

Which window size works best for the model?

FNG 10-day window loss = 0.0816; Closing 10 day window loss = 0.0146

FNG 5-day window loss = 0.0756; Closing 5 day window loss = 0.0045

FNG 2 day window loss = 0.0748; Closing; 2 day window loss = 0.0077

Based on the results above, the 2 day window size works best for the model.
